Description: They're all creepy, and there's nine of them. From Edith Wharton to Virginia Woolf, these stories run the gamut of haunted house tropes, and some turn the formula on its head! The editor & introduction author William McGovern had to crawl through an old attic to rediscover some of these stories, and he even got bit by a spider while doing so.
